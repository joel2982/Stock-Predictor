By combining sentimental analysis of news headlines with numerical analysis of past stock prices, a hybrid model for predicting stock price and performance is created. In this, I used sentiment analysis to predict whether a company's stock will rise or fall based on news headlines. Using Python and machine learning, this model will predict whether the price of a stock will rise or fall based on the sentiment of the day's most popular news item headlines.

## Time series analysis is performed on the Stock data

## Sentiment analysis is performed on the News data.
