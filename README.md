Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines In this I have predicted if a companies stock will increase or decrease based on news headlines using sentiment analysis.This model will determine if the price of a stock will increase or decrease based on the sentiment of top news article headlines for the current day using Python and machine learning.
I have used both numerical and textual data for this.

(i) Time series analysis is performed on the Stock data

(ii) Sentiment analysis is performed on the News data.

(iii) An analysis is performed by merging both the data to predict if the Close price of the stock will increase or decrease.
